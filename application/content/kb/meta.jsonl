However, we are\nunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.\nMore to Know!\nIf an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\nlight with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it.

You are familiar with the formation of image\nby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is\nequal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror\nas the object is in front of it. Further, the image is laterally inverted.\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved?

How does the image\nlook like now?\nn\nCompare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\nmirror. The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical\nmirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form\na part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\nare spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\noutwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,\nthat is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\na convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown\nin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back\nof the mirror is shaded.\nYou may now understand that the surface of the spoon\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\napproximated to a convex mirror.\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical \nmirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface of the \nmirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P.\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nSchematic representation of spherical\nmirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b) Convex mirror"}

This point is called the centre of curvature of\nthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the\ncentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\nHowever, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\nof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\nreflecting sunlight.

What do you observe? Why?\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is\nthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\napproximate value of focal length of the mirror.\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\nof a ray diagram.\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\npoint on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called\nthe principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\nthe principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus\nis represented by the letter F. The distance between the\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\nthe focal length. It is represented by the letter f.\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b) Convex mirror\n(b)\n(a)"}

The diameter of the reflecting\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\nrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature.\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\nput this as R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\n9.2.1 Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\nYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors?

Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\nin front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a\npoint could be considered.

These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\noutwards.

These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror, the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance (u). The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance (v). You already know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length (f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirror formula which is\nexpressed as\n1\n1\n1\nv\nu\nf\n+\n=\n(9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject.

It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = \nHeight of the image (\n)\nHeight of the object ( )\n′\nh\nh\nm = \n′\nh\nh\n(9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and\nimage distance (v). It can be expressed as:\nMagnification (m) = \n′ = −\nh\nh\nv\nu\n(9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as \nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis. The height of the \nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images. However, it is to be \ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the \nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value \nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors"}

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its \ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond \ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab \nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed \nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil \npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced \nat the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon \nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual \nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such \nexperiences?\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil, \npartly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the \npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared \nto the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at \nthe interface.

This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsin\ni\nr = constant\n(9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first. Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1. In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21= Speed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12.

It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density.

Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses. Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses.

In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat. This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens. What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis.

Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci. They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11.

It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D. This means the lens\nprescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m. The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, … as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.

You also studied the nature, position and relative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure. What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter.\nWe have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe human eye is like a camera. Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil. The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nThe human eye"}

The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells. The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals. These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves. The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases. This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation. However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit. Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes. The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far-\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia. These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects\nand their correction."}

A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)\nHypermetropia\nHypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b).

You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray.

Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. You might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain \nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of \nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar \nprism. However, he could not get any more colours. He \nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position \nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This \nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through \nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging \nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation \ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven \ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of \nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky \nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion \nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the \natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction \nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like \nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident \nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it \nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due \nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different \ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when \nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water \nfountain, with the Sun behind you.\nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 Rainbow formation\nSunlight\nRaindrop"}

The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\nReprint 2025-26"}

The blue colour of the sky, colour of \nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset \nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous \nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. \nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. \nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the \nsize of the particles is relatively larger.\n10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles. \nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles \nof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine \nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us, \nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of \nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect \nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a \nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole. \nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can \nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense \nforest. Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering \nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of \nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths. If the size of the scattering \nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear \nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size \nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in \nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer \nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8 \ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the \natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter \nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters \nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been \nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark. The sky appears \ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not \nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour. \nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke. Therefore, \nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\nReprint 2025-26"}

It is a controllable\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\nWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off ), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges."}

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\nV\n=\nW/Q\n(11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745 –1827), an Italian physicist.

(11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it.

For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat.

This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc.\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ.

In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit.

It controls\nthe magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Ω).\nn\nOhm’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly\nproportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.\nn\nThe resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of\ncross-section, and also on the material of the conductor.\nn\nThe equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of\ntheir individual resistances.\nn\nA set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance Rp given by\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n...\np\nR\nR\nR\nR\n=\n+\n+\n+\nn\nThe electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by\nW = V × I × t\nn\nThe unit of power is watt (W). One watt of power is consumed when 1 A of current\nflows at a potential difference of 1 V.\nn\nThe commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt hour (kWh).\n1 kW h = 3,600,000 J = 3.6 × 106 J.\nSolution\nThe total energy consumed by the refrigerator in 30 days would be\n400 W × 8.0 hour/day × 30 days = 96000 W h\n= 96 kW h\nThus the cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days is\n96 kW h × Rs 3.00 per kW h = Rs 288.00"}

We know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it.

By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop.

If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe force acting on the conductor.\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be\n(a)\nto the right.\n(b)\nto the left.\n(c)\nout of the page.\n(d)\ninto the page.\nSolution\nAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand\nrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction\nof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFleming’s left-hand rule\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhich of the following property of a proton can change while it moves\nfreely in a magnetic field?

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.\n2.\nIn Activity 12.7, how do we think the displacement of rod AB will be\naffected if (i) current in rod AB is increased; (ii) a stronger horse-shoe\nmagnet is used; and (iii) length of the rod AB is increased?\n3.\nA positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is\ndeflected towards north by a magnetic field. The direction of magnetic\nfield is\n(a)\ntowards south\n(b)\ntowards east\n(c)\ndownward\n(d)\nupward\nMagnetism in medicine\nAn electric current always produces a magnetic field. Even weak ion currents that\ntravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch\nsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This\nimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are\nabout one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human\nbody where the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. The\nmagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis\nof these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses\nin medicine.\nMore to Know!"}

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1.\nName two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2.\nAn electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A.
